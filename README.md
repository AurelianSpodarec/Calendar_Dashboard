## Motivation

I wanted to expand my knowledge of JavaScript and grasp new concepts, meanwhile at the same time learn about how Single Page Application works under the hood.

I have used ideas from React and Redux. Why? Because I get to use the entire JavaScript engine and use every single bit to get more practice with no abstraction. I used thing such as: Classes, Objects, Arrays of Objets, Functions for Objects, how to work with data, how exactly `this` works, and most importantly how to utilize all of that, to solve the problem I'm having.

I've also wanted to create a UI Library and really polish my architecture of CSS/Scss on a large project, which will allow me to get out from my comfort zone and expand. I've used front-end Methodologies such as BEM and properly set up each file, so it has the ability to scale, maintain and add new features in record time!

So, what is the best way to improve? Get an exciting project to work on and start outputting some code!
