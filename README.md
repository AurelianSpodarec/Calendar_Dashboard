## Motivation

The project exists because I wanted to expand my JavaScript knowledge and graps new concepts. And the best way to do it? Get an exciting project to work on and start writing some code!

I wanted to challenge my self and see if I can create a Calendar, a ToDo (well,the project is in early stages) but that's the intention.

I have used ideas of React and Redux for my project, so I can understand how React and SPA applications actually work under the hood. 

Another readon I've choosed to develop a dashbord is so I can work on a UI library and get the max out of architecturing the project by using some front-end Methodologies such as BEM, and properly set up the settings file so the project can be scaled and maintained in the long term run.
